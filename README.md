# Ecriture_Manuscrite
The goal of this project is to take pictures of documents as inputs, and generate datasets for Deep Learning inputs. It is also planned to train a Neuronal Network so as to translate the words on the picture to "String".

The training data will come from the Maurdor document base and the skeleton of the Neuronal Network we will use is from Laia.

This project is a M1 project from INSA students in IT with the help of Bertrand Couasnon from the Intuidoc team of IRISA and Erwan Foucher and Julien Bouvet from Sopra Steria.
